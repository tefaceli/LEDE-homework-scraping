# LEDE-homework-scraping1

This is a repository for the homework we did on the LEDE Program at Columbia J School, doing scraping with BeautifulSoup in some different webpages.

In here you will find four different Jypyter notebooks with scraping for the following pages:
- Wikipedia - table
- Le Monde in its english version
- A table in an Arizona webpage
- A US Court search system

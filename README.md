# LEDE-homework-scraping1

This is a repository for the homework we did on the LEDE Program at Columbia J School, doing scraping with BeautifulSoup in some different webpages.

In here you will find four directories with Jypyter notebooks with scraping:
- Part 1 - tables from Wikipedia
- Part 2 - Le Monde site in its english version, with automated scraping every 2 hours
- Part 3 - A table in an Arizona webpage
- Part 4 - A US Court search system
